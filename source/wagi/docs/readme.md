# WAGI-dotnet

This package provides a configuration driven method to add WASM WAGI modules as route endpoints to ASP.Net Core applications using [WAGI](https://github.com/deislabs/wagi#wagi-webassembly-gateway-interface).

_WAGI is the easiest way to get started doing cloud-side WASM web apps._

***WARNING:*** WAGI is experimental. It is not considered production-grade by its developers, neither is it "supported" software.

>DeisLabs is experimenting with many WASM technologies right now. This is one of a multitude of projects (including Krustlet) designed to test the limits of WebAssembly as a cloud-based runtime.
